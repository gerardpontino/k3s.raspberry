## Introduction

Are you curious about Kubernetes and want to experiment with it? Do you have a Raspberry Pi 4's lying around and want to put it to good use? If so, you’re in luck! In this blog, I’ll show you how to build a simple and lightweight Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi 4 with k3s. It’s an affordable and accessible way to explore the world of Kubernetes, without breaking the bank. Let’s get started!

## Topology of our setup

## Hardware

3 x Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB
2x Kingston CANVAS Select Plus SD Card 32GB
52pi Rack Tower Cluster Case
1x Kingston A400 SSD (240GB)
TP-Link TLSG108 8-Port gigabit Desktop Switch (You may also use 4-Port Switch)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing the OS

I used the Raspberry Pi Imager to install the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) onto an SD card. During the setup process (as outlined in Step 4 below), you’ll be prompted to configure settings such as the hostname, username, and more.”
